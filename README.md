# dvd demo


The project uses following technologies(frameworks):

- Back-end Framework [SpringBoot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
- DataBase [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Front-end MVC Framework [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)
- Template Engine [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/)
    


To run this up, you need to do following things first.


1. You need to install the mongodb first, and run it up on the default port.
2. download the code and build it as a jar, run it with cmd or in Eclipse/IDEA

``` java
    $ java -jar dvdDemo.jar
```

This is my first demo that can be seemed as a project. I will provide more default demo project as the time goes by.
And I want to thanks my first job here, I learned so many things at here.
