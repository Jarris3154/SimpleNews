##This is my first time to submit the codes!
	Thanks for Emerson and its project TAF, because when I was working there, I learned github and many things.
	
	
	
	
	So this is a demo for a simple project for news, to practice my code ability and learn new techs.
	The framework has been used in this project is below:
	
	SprinBootFramework + Mongodb
